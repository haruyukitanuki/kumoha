#### üöÑ About the Name

**Kumoha** is a Japanese railway classification prefix used to designate an electric multiple unit (EMU) car that is both motorized and equipped with a driving cab. The name is composed of:

- **Ku („ÇØ)**: indicating a control (driving) cab is present,  
- **Mo („É¢)**: indicating that the car has traction motors,  
- **Ha („Éè)**: indicating a passenger car.

## üì¶ Installation

This package is published as `@tanuden/kumoha`.

```bash
npm install @tanuden/kumoha
```
* Works on both frontend and backend environments
* For React users, it's recommended to use [`@tanuden/kumoha-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tanuden/kumoha-react) and consume the hooks it provides

## üìö Basic Usage
```ts
import { Kumoha } from '@tanuden/kumoha';

const engine = Kumoha("ws://localhost:58680", {
  socketOptions: {
    // socket.io options (not recommended to modify unless necessary)
  }
});

// Example login with room ID "ABC123"
await engine.login('ABC123');

// Example button action sending "DoorOpn" (door open)
await engine.sendButtonAction('DoorOpn', true);
```
* The port number in the URI (58680) is fixed by the Tanuden Console and should not be changed.
* Modifying socketOptions is generally not recommended unless you have specific advanced use cases.
